### Introduction

This document is the result of the collaborative discussion that has been taking place in the [Open Design Working Group](http://design.okfn.org/) of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/).
Please join the conversation about the definition on the [Open Design Definition repository](https://github.com/OpenDesign-WorkingGroup/Open-Design-Definition) and on the [Open Design Working Group mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/opendesign) (past archives are available [here](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/opendesign/))

This document represents a shared agreement about the definition of Open Design, and should not be understood as a license for Design content. The purpose of this document is to foster discussion, collaboration and community building around the concept and the practice of Open Design.


### Open Source and Open Content regarding Open Design

*Here we should develop our understanding of Open Source / Open Content of Open Design. Should be short and clarify the framework.*

*If we feel that we need to clarify something about Freedom vs. Openness it should be done here* 

Open Design should always be considered in its political dimension, because transparency, collaboration and release of resources are strategies that do not fully guarantee the balance and social justice by themselves. Furthermore, by making open design project we will unconver their political dimension by making everybody aware of the impact on the social, economic, and environmental dimension of everybody's life.

### Branches of Open Design

*Here we should discuss all the kinds of Design (Product Design, Graphic Design) that can be Open Design and what is the source code for them and the binary code*


### The Open Data of Open Design

*Here we should discuss the issue of all the knowledge and related data for Open Design projects. For example: supply chain, material processes, how to repair / reproduce / manufacture a project, the carbon footprint of the manufacturing and distribution processes and so on*

### Hacking Open Design: Redesign

*Here we should clarify wether redesigning closed design projects can make them open*

Redesigning an existing proprietary design cannot make it Open Design. However, if we use an existing design as a component to include o modify in our project, and we release the instructions for using or modifying such design, these instructions are Open Design.

### The process of Open Design

*Here we should discuss if there's anything more that we can add about the processes around the development of Open Design projects*

Design also means the design process of developing an Open Design project.Open Design does not refer to and is not defined by a specific design process. Most of the time the design process of an Open Design project will not be documented and therefore there is no need to publish this documentation. However, if the design process of an Open Design project is documented, this documentation should be published together with the Open Design project, in order to make even the process an open one. 

###Â Open Design and necessary software

*Here we should discuss the relationship between Open Design and the necessary software for opening / designing / making it real* 

When presented publicly, outcomes and byproducts of an open design work must be distributed with the source of the open design work that were used to produce such outcomes and byproducts. The source files must be available with open and interchangeable file formats, in order to let anybody access them and edit them with easily accessible software, tools and technologies.

### Open Design and Intellectual Property

*Here we should clarify the relationships between different branches and entities for Design projects and the intellectual property laws developed for them. It should not be a license but should be a starting point for clarifying any issue with licenses or patenting*
