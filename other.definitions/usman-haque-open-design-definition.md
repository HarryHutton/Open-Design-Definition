Open Design Definition by Usman Haque
=====================================

Open design is the development of physical products, machines and systems
through use of publicly shared design information.
The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often performed
without monetary compensation.
The goals and philosophy are identical to that of the open-source movement,
but are implemented for the development of physical products rather
than software.
