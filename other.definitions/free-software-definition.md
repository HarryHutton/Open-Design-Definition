The Free Software Definition
============================


What is free software?
----------------------

### The Free Software Definition

> The free software definition presents the criteria for whether a
> particular software program qualifies as free software. From time to
> time we revise this definition, to clarify it or to resolve questions
> about subtle issues. See the [History section][] below for a list of
> changes that affect the definition of free software.

“Free software” means software that respects users’ freedom and
community. Roughly, **the users have the freedom to run, copy,
distribute, study, change and improve the software**. With these
freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the
program and what it does for them.

When users don’t control the program, the program controls the users.
The developer controls the program, and through it controls the users.
This nonfree or “proprietary” program is therefore an instrument of
unjust power.

Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand
the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in
“free beer”.

A program is free software if the program’s users have the four
essential freedoms:

-   The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
-   The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
    your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is
    a precondition for this.
-   The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
    (freedom 2).
-   The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
    (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
    to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a
    precondition for this.

A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms. Thus,
you should be free to redistribute copies, either with or without
modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to
[anyone anywhere][]. Being free to do these things means (among other
things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission to do so.

You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them
privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they
exist. If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to
notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way.

The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person
or organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind
of overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about
it with the developer or any other specific entity. In this freedom, it
is the *user’s* purpose that matters, not the *developer’s* purpose; you
as a user are free to run the program for your purposes, and if you
distribute it to someone else, she is then free to run it for her
purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her.

The freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable
forms of the program, as well as source code, for both modified and
unmodified versions. (Distributing programs in runnable form is
necessary for conveniently installable free operating systems.) It is OK
if there is no way to produce a binary or executable form for a certain
program (since some languages don’t support that feature), but you must
have the freedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a
way to make them.

In order for freedoms 1 and 3 (the freedom to make changes and the
freedom to publish improved versions) to be meaningful, you must have
access to the source code of the program. Therefore, accessibility of
source code is a necessary condition for free software. Obfuscated
“source code” is not real source code and does not count as source code.

Freedom 1 includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of
the original. If the program is delivered in a product designed to run
someone else’s modified versions but refuse to run yours — a practice
known as “tivoization” or “lockdown”, or (in its practitioners’ perverse
terminology) as “secure boot” — freedom 1 becomes a theoretical fiction
rather than a practical freedom. This is not sufficient. In other words,
these binaries are not free software even if the source code they are
compiled from is free.

One important way to modify a program is by merging in available free
subroutines and modules. If the program’s license says that you cannot
merge in a suitably licensed existing module — for instanc TRUNCATED!
