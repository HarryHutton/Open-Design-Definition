The Self-Repair Manifesto
==========================

Repair is better than recycling.
--------------------------------
Making our things last longer is both more efficient and more cost-effective than mining them for raw materials.

Repair saves the planet.
------------------------
Earth has limited resources and we can't run a linear manufacturing process forever. The best way to be efficient is to reuse what we already have!

Repair saves you money.
-----------------------
Fixing things is often free, and usually cheaper than replacing them. Doing the repair yourself saves serious dough.

Repair teaches engineering.
---------------------------
The best way to find out how something works is to take it apart!

If you can't fix it, you don't own it.
--------------------------------------
Repair connects people and devices, creating bonds that transcend consumption. Self-repair is sustainable.
