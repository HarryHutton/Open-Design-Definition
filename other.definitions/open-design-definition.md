The Open Design Definition, V. 0.2
==================================

*For the motivation and background to this document take a look at the [Preamble](http://opendesign.org/pre_odd.html).* 

## 1. Free Redistribution  

The license may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the embodiment as a component of an aggregate embodiment distribution containing embodiments from several different sources. While it is completely acceptable to sale and distribute Open Designed embodiments for profit, the license can not require a royalty or other fee for such sale. 

## 2. Design Documentation  

The embodiment must include design documentation, and it must allow distribution of design documentation as well as manufactured form. Where some embodiment is not distributed with design documentation, there must be a well-publicized means for downloading the design documentation, without charge, via the Internet. The design documentation must be the preferred form in which a designer would modify the embodiment (e.g. native file format used to create the design document). Deliberately obfuscating design documentation is not allowed. Intermediate forms (e.g. read only documents, G&M codes for a machined parts, or STEP translations of model files) are not allowed. 

## 3. Derived Works  

The license must allow modifications and derived works, and it must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original embodiment. 

## 4. Integrity of the Designer's Design Documentation  

The license may restrict design documentation from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "retrofit documentation" with the design documentation for the purpose of modifying the embodiment at manufacture. The license must explicitly permit distribution of embodiments built from modified design documentation. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original design. 

## 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups  

The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. 

## 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor  

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the embodiment in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the embodiment from being <need better example?> used in a business, or from being used for genetic research. 

## 7. Distribution of License  

The rights attached to the embodiment must apply to all to whom the embodiment is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties. 

## 8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product  

The rights attached to the embodiment must not depend on the embodiment's being part of a particular embodiment distribution. If the embodiment is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the embodiment's license, all parties to whom the embodiment is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original embodiment distribution. For example, if someone decides to use the MIT Open Linear stage within a proprietary machine, then the proprietary machine must be distributed with the open design rights to the embedded MIT Open Linear stage. 

## 9. License Must Not Contaminate Other Designs  

The license must not place restrictions on other embodiments that are distributed along with the licensed embodiment. For example, the license must not insist that all other embodiments distributed along with the licensed embodiment be open-design embodiments. 

## Example Licenses  

Example licenses for Open Design are under development.
